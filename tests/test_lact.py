"""Tests for the LaCT fast-weight memory.

These pin two separate things:

* that the corrected update is *mathematically* an update — the upstream
  bidirectional file fails `test_zero_lr_is_a_noop` outright, which is how the
  bug was found;
* that the memory demonstrably *retains* written content, because an experiment
  asking "does TTT retain bindings" is meaningless if the substrate cannot
  retain anything at all.

    "fast weights cannot hold a binding".

    This test removes perception from the loop by writing the facts as text
    embeddings, then asks the memory the same question the benchmark asks. If
    it passes, the write/revoke/read chain is sound and any failure on the
    fixture belongs to the encoder.
